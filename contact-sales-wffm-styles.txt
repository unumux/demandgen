The following style block needs to be copied into the Header Snippet field of the page item that will be displaying the form.

On a form, if a section has it's Appearance > Show Title set to Yes, the title will be visible, more more importantly for DOM selectors
it will insert a <fieldset> container around the fields in that section.  Helpful for css/js selectors, but it goes away if Show Title = No.

The fieldset container will also be missing if you don't enter a value for the section title. (even if Show Title = Yes)

<style>
/* hide primary form + submit button initially */
form[data-wffm] fieldset{ 
    display: none;
}
form[data-wffm] input[type=submit].btn{
    display: none;
}

/* hide custom message initially */
#customMessageEl{
    display: none;
    padding-top: 1rem;
}
</style>
